ToDo:
------

2012-09-24:
* message box creation:
"mktemp" evaluates the env var TEMPDIR when using "-p" on SLES10. Hence
temp message boxes are created in the wrong locations. Using "unset TEMPDIR"
in the "ipc/file.bashlib" solves this issue.


gschedule.bashlib:

* Implement general functions like schedule(), isRunableJob() that use the
  configured scheduler

sputnik.bash:

* Add functionality for automatic job restart
* Add cleanup function for trap
* Check functionality

gsatctl.bash:

* change help message or implement described functionality

Scheduling:

* Directory locking for gschedule related functions                             [partly implemented]

* Test scheduling functionality with simple "sleep X" jobs (both locally and    [ok]
  over NFS)

General:

* Create NFS test environment (1 server, 2 clients)                             [ok]
* Create manual pages for tools and perhaps also for libs                       [partly implemented]
* Implement automatic start of gsatlc and signal forwarder

* !IMPORTANT! After sending a message, the receivers message box must be touched! [ok]

WORKING:
---------

* gqsub
* gqstat
* gqdel
* fifo scheduling
* sputnik (running job, no automatic restart currently and no different job types)
* gsatlc
* sigfwd
* general message passing works (incl. signal forwarding) but is not fast (e.g.:
"
hlr000fs@nfs-client1:~/tmp$ time gqsub $PWD/job1
00000

real	0m3.671s
user	0m0.316s
sys	0m0.760s
"
)

If sender and receiver are on the same host, the needed time is cut by half.
