# gsatellite - Your personal job scheduler

"gsatellite" - or short "gsat" - is a rather complete set of tools that in
combination comprise a small job scheduler for personal use. In combination with
gtransfer, gsat allows to submit and schedule possibly long running data
transfer jobs and let them run and be monitored by a process under full control
of but without the need of interference by a user. This way a user can log in to
a or multiple (frontend) machines, submit his jobs and leave and let gsat take
care of the remaining work, which includes:

* scheduling a job (with a plugin and hence interchangeable scheduler)
* running a job
* monitoring a job
* and possibly rerunning a job that failed

A user can then return at any time and check the status of its jobs.
