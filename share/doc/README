# gsatellite - Your personal job scheduler #

"gsatellite" - or short "gsat" - is a rather complete set of tools that in
combination comprise a small job scheduler for personal use. In combination with
gtransfer, gsat allows to submit and schedule possibly long running (data
transfer) jobs and let them run and be monitored by a process under full control
of but without the need of interference by a user. This way a user can log in to
one or multiple (frontend) machines, submit his jobs and leave and let gsat take
care of the remaining work, which includes:

* scheduling a job (with a plugin scheduler (currently FIFO and non-batch schedulers available)
* running a job
* monitoring a job
* and possibly rerunning a job that failed (see [demo#2](https://github.com/fr4nk5ch31n3r/gsatellite/wiki/Gsatellite-demo-02) for details)

A user can then return at any time and check the status of its jobs.

Please consider the [gsatellite wiki pages](https://github.com/fr4nk5ch31n3r/gsatellite/wiki)
on GitHub for more details and [demo#1](https://github.com/fr4nk5ch31n3r/gsatellite/wiki/Gsatellite-demo-01) for general usage and features of gsatellite.
